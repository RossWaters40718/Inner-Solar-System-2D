This Python Project Was Created For Windows 11 Using Python 3.12.2. All Imports Are Up-To-Date As Of 04/20/2024. When Creating An Executable Using This Script, Make Sure To Include The Astroquery Folder In Your Project Using PyInstaller Or auto-py-to-exe. This Folder And The Citation File Inside Is Not Automatically Created And The Executable Will Error Out Without This Included. I Have Tried Many Things Without Success. The Astropy Citation File Is Automatically Created But The Astroquery Citation File Is Not. I Have Included This Folder And File For This Reason. Another Option Is Just Use My Setup File Located In The Misc Folder.
